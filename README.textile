h2. How to use

Download the archive, unpack it, and upload the contents to your conversion installation (phpBB3), you should have two more files in the install/convertors/ directory at the end. Then run the conversion as normally(click the Convert tab on the installation screen), but select this convertor from the list.

h2. Table prefix

don't include the "bb" in the prefix, use the same prefix as set in the NUKE config.php (just add an underscore - "_")
Former board path: Set it to the phpBB root, not the NUKE root, it is probably going to end with modules/Forums/
